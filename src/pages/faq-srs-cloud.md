## Video Guides

The following are video materials for answering questions, which explain a certain topic in detail. If your question is similar, please watch the video directly:

* [How to Do Virtual Live Streaming by SRS Cloud](https://youtu.be/68PIGFDGihU)

<a name='getting-started'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to get started

Please purchase and set up [SRS Cloud Server](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?appId=133468816&size=s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb&region=sgp1&image=ossrs-srs&type=applications) first. 

After entering the SRS Cloud Server, there will be corresponding video tutorials according to different application scenarios, as shown in the following figure:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-01.png)

Each scenario also has a complete introduction and detailed operation steps, as shown in the following figure:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-02.png)

Please do not try randomly, be sure to follow the guide, audio and video random testing will definitely cause problems.

<a name="how-to-upgrade"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to upgrade

How to upgrade to the latest version or stable version, and why not support click upgrade on the interface?

Since Cloud SRS supports multiple platforms, including Docker, and Docker cannot upgrade itself, Cloud SRS also does not support interface upgrades and needs to be upgraded manually.

The Docker startup specifies the version, such as `ossrs/srs-cloud:v1.0.293`, and you only need to delete the container and start with the new version, such as `ossrs/srs-cloud:v1.0.299`.

If you use `ossrs/srs-cloud:1`, it is the latest version, and you need to update manually, such as `docker pull ossrs/srs-cloud:1`.

If you use BT panel, just delete the application and reinstall the new version, the data is saved in the `/data` directory and will not be lost.

<a name="how-to-set-domain"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to set a domain

How to set up a domain to access the admin panel, why can't the admin panel be opened, and why can't the admin panel be accessed via IP.

Please replace the following domain names and IPs with your own domain names and IPs, which can be either private or public IPs, as long as your browser can access them.

When installing Cloud SRS with aaPanel, you need to enter the domain name of the management backend, such as `bt.yourdomain.com`, and it will automatically create the management backend website.

If you install it in other ways, it's the same. You just need to resolve your domain name to the Cloud SRS IP.

There are several ways to set up domain name resolution:

1. DNS domain name resolution: In the backend of your domain name provider, set an A record pointing to the Cloud SRS IP.
```text
A bt.yourdomain.com 121.13.75.20
```
2. Modify the local `/etc/hosts` file in Linux/Unix to resolve the domain name to the Cloud SRS IP.
```text
121.13.75.20 bt.yourdomain.com
```
3. Modify the local `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` file in Windows to resolve the domain name to the Cloud SRS IP.
```text
121.13.75.20 bt.yourdomain.com
```

Note: If you need to apply for a free HTTPS certificate through Let's Encrypt, the IP address must be a public IP, and you cannot use the method of modifying the hosts file.

<a name="support-platform"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Supported platforms

Cloud SRS supports Docker, install script, DigitalOcean images, and other platforms can be installed with aaPanel.

Cloud SRS is, of course, supported on various cloud platforms. The most convenient way is to use images, which are images of cloud servers. If you want to keep it simple and save trouble, please use images. Other methods are prone to problems. Please do not overestimate your ability to tinker. Most people really belong to the 80% who can't tinker. It is strongly recommended to use images:

* [Run by docker image](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-cloud#usage)
* DigitalOcean: Overseas lightweight cloud server image, use reference [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_GcJm15BGv1qbmHixPQAGQ)

If you don't want to use virtual machine images and want to install directly on a server or command line, or install with aaPanel, that's no problem:

* aaPanel: If your machine is overseas, be sure to use aaPanel instead of BT panel, use reference [here](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-setup-a-video-streaming-service-by-aapanel-9748ae754c8c)

> Note: If you want to install Cloud SRS from the command line, you can first install BT panel from the command line, and then install Cloud SRS.

<a name='multile-streams'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to push multiple streams

By default, there is only one push stream address. What if you want to push multiple streams? How to change the stream address?

You can change the stream name, for example, the default push stream address is:

* `rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/livestream?secret=xxx`

You can modify `livestream` to any other name, and then push directly:

* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`any`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`stream`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`you`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`want`?secret=xxx

As shown in the figure below, you can click the update button to automatically change the push stream and playback name:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-03.png)

> Note: Of course, the playback must also be changed to the corresponding stream name.

<a name="bandwidth"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Low bandwidth, increase bandwidth

The bandwidth of lightweight application servers ranges from 4 to 20Mbps, which is somewhat limited for audio and video. If you want higher bandwidth, such as 100Mbps, you can choose CVM or AWS VPS.

> Note: The usage of Cloud SRS is consistent, but the purchase and platform configuration are different.

The advantages of CVM cloud servers are:

* The bandwidth can be up to 100Mbps, and multiple platforms can be used to forward to other CVM servers. Ten CVMs can achieve 1Gbps bandwidth, but of course, you have to consider your budget.
* Pay-as-you-go, you can stop the machine at any time without charge, and use it again when needed. It is more friendly for low-frequency application scenarios.

The disadvantages of CVM cloud servers are:

* High cost, no free traffic package. Lightweight servers have low cost, and the free traffic package is basically enough for general live streaming. So please calculate the cost yourself.
* Complex operation, CVM's security group is much more complicated than the lightweight firewall operation. Please try it yourself. If it doesn't work, switch to lightweight.
* No background link, the interface is more complex. If it doesn't work, switch to lightweight.

If you still want to choose CVM after knowing the advantages and disadvantages, please refer to [Cloud SRS: Support CVM image](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/x-PjoKjJj6HRF-eCKX0KzQ).

<a name="https"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to set up free HTTPS

Cloud SRS supports applying for free HTTPS certificates, and you can apply for certificates for multiple domain names and automatically renew them. For example, the certificates for the following HTTPS websites are all automatically applied after running Cloud SRS:

* https://ossrs.io SRS's overseas documentation website.
* https://www.ossrs.io SRS's overseas documentation website.
* https://r.ossrs.net SRS's stable version demo server.

The operation is very simple, just follow these three steps, please see [here](https://ossrs.net/lts/blog/2022/04/12/SRS-Cloud-HTTPS):

1. Purchase a domain name and complete the filing. You must have your own legal domain name, otherwise, you cannot apply for a certificate.
2. Resolve the domain name to the public IP of Cloud SRS. You can add multiple domain names to resolve, for example, `ossrs.io` and `www.ossrs.io` are both resolved to the same Cloud SRS server.
3. In Cloud SRS's `System Settings > HTTPS > Automatic HTTPS Certificate`, fill in your domain name, separate multiple domain names with semicolons, and click Apply.

> Note: Just apply for the domain name, do not upload it again. Once applied, you don't need to upload it again.

> Note: Please use aaPanel to apply, the operation steps are similar to the above. Cloud SRS will no longer support certificate application, because certbot does not support multi-platform docker images, and there will be problems when using it on other platforms.

After the application is successful, enter https plus your domain name in the browser, and you can access your website.

<a name="update-publish-secret"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to modify the push authentication key

If you need to update the push authentication key or change the push key, you can follow these steps:

1. Enter the `System Settings` panel.
2. Select the `Stream Authentication` tab.
3. Enter the new stream key.
4. Click the `Update` button.
5. Refresh the pages of each scene, and the push key will be automatically updated.

As shown in the picture below:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-04.png)

If you need to disable push authentication, please refer to the instructions below.

<a name="no-publish-auth"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to disable push authentication

In the scene page, the standard push format is with `?secret=xxx` authentication, such as `rtmp://ip/live/livestream?secret=xxx`

It is found that some cameras do not support the `?secret=xxx` format, so the address is not supported.

In this case, you can actually put the key `xxx` directly in the stream name, such as: `rtmp://ip/live/livestreamsecretxxx`, and there will be no problem.

Of course, if you only need to push one stream, you can directly use the key as the stream name, such as: `rtmp://ip/live/xxx`.

> Note: Of course, the playback must also be changed to the same stream name, and the key must be included, because the key is placed in the stream name here, so the playback must also be changed.

This way, there is security, and it can support devices that do not support special characters. In addition, the push key can be changed, so you can change it to the way you want.

<a name="record"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to record to local disk

How to record to the local disk of Cloud SRS? After upgrading to v1.0.252, you can see local recording in the recording.

For the limitations and solutions of local recording, please refer to #42

<a name="cos-vs-vod"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Difference between cloud recording and cloud on-demand

Cloud SRS provides two similar functions, cloud recording and cloud on-demand. What is the difference between using cloud recording or cloud on-demand for recording?

Cloud recording can be considered as writing live streaming to the cloud disk, saving it in HLS format, which is the original video stream. If you want to download HLS for transcoding and editing, it would be more suitable. Cloud recording is stored in Tencent Cloud COS cloud storage, which can be considered as an unlimited disk, avoiding overwriting the disk of Cloud SRS.

Cloud on-demand provides both HLS and MP4 formats, and more features will be added in the future, such as outputting multiple bit rates, adding logos and watermarks, media asset management, and many other useful features. Cloud on-demand is a video-on-demand system, not just a storage disk. It can be considered as a Bilibili or YouTube. If you want to do more diverse businesses, you must choose cloud on-demand.

In terms of cost, cloud on-demand will be slightly higher than cloud recording, depending on which features are used. Currently, Cloud SRS uses HLS to MP4 conversion, which is very low in cost because there is no transcoding. In the future, if you want to use advanced features, the cost will be higher. Overall, the cost of cloud on-demand is very low, similar to cloud recording. If there is no additional computing cost, it will be the same as cloud recording.

In short, it is recommended to use cloud on-demand, which is easy to use and not expensive.

<a name="dvr-cloud-storage"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to record to cloud storage

Cloud SRS supports recording to COS, Tencent Cloud Storage. Please refer to [Usage: Cloud Storage](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/axN_TPo-Gk_H7CbdqUud6g).

Cloud SRS can also record to other cloud storage, such as Alibaba Cloud OSS or AWS S3. According to the guidance of cloud storage, mount the cloud storage to Cloud SRS, and then use local recording, configure the local storage path, so that you can write files to cloud storage.

> Note: To modify the local recording path, you can go to `Local Recording/Recording Folder`, and soft link the recording path to the cloud storage path.

<a name="unavailable"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Unable to access after installation

After installation, an error is prompted, such as:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-05.png)

Or Redis is not ready, such as:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-06.png)

This is because it takes time for Cloud SRS to start after installation. Refresh the page after waiting for 3 to 5 minutes.

<a name="restream-vs-obs"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Difference between SRS Restream and OBS Restream

SRS's multi-platform restreaming can push the stream to multiple platforms, and its working diagram is as follows:

```
OBS/FFmpeg --RTMP--> Cloud SRS --RTMP--> Video number, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and other live streaming platforms
```

In fact, OBS also has a restreaming plugin, and its working diagram is as follows:

```
OBS --RTMP--> Video number, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and other live streaming platforms
```

It seems that OBS's link is shorter and simpler, and it doesn't need to go through Cloud SRS or pay money. So why does Cloud SRS still need to do restreaming, and what are the drawbacks of OBS's solution?

The advantage of OBS restreaming is that it doesn't cost money and can be restreamed directly. The disadvantage is that its uplink/upload bandwidth is doubled. For example, a 2Mbps stream, if restreamed to 3 platforms, will be 6Mbps. If more video numbers need to be pushed, it will be even more, such as pushing to 10 platforms, which will be 20Mbps.

Higher bandwidth will cause all push streams to stutter or interrupt, making it impossible for all viewers to watch the live broadcast, resulting in a live broadcast accident. As long as there is a rollover once, most of the people in the live broadcast room will run away, which is a very serious accident.

Basically, 80% of live broadcast rollovers are caused by problems with the anchor's push stream. Because the problems of cloud platforms and viewer viewing have been almost solved, the only unsolvable problem is the anchor's push stream.

If you have a dedicated fiber-optic line at home, such as buying a 100Mbps dedicated line, there will be no problem. The problem is that a 100Mbps dedicated line is very expensive, and even if it is temporarily free, there will be a day when it will be charged because a dedicated line is a dedicated resource and cannot be free forever. It's like someone giving you gold bars for free, how long can it be free?

Cloud SRS also has doubled bandwidth, but it is the downstream bandwidth that is doubled because it has done a conversion, and essentially other platforms are downloading the stream from Cloud SRS. Downstream/download bandwidth is generally more guaranteed. Moreover, between Cloud SRS and the platform, they are all BGP bandwidth between servers, which is more guaranteed in quality than the home-to-platform connection.

<a name="restream-custom"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How SRS Restreams to Custom Platforms

SRS's multi-platform restreaming can push to custom live streaming platforms, such as pushing to the video number's push stream address and stream key, and can also fill in any other live streaming platform.

> Note: The reason why Cloud SRS is divided into video numbers and platforms like Bilibili is to provide better guidance. The RTMP address format of these platforms is similar, so you can fill in any platform, and Cloud SRS will not verify the specific platform.

If the RTMP address of the live streaming platform is a single address, such as:

```
rtmp://ip/app/stream
```

Then, you can split it into:

* Push stream address: `rtmp://ip/app`
* Stream key: `stream`

> Note: The part after the last slash is the stream key.

<a name="use-custom-ffmpeg"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Replace FFmpeg

If you are using the Docker version, you can replace the FFmpeg in Cloud SRS with a custom version by specifying the command at startup:

```bash
-v /path/to/ffmpeg:/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
```

You can use the command `which ffmpeg` to find the path of your FFmpeg.

> Note: Non-Docker versions are not supported.

<a name='install-speedup'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Baota Installation of SRS is Very Slow

Some users have reported that overseas Baota installations are very slow, and accessing Alibaba Cloud's mirror is too slow.

This is because Baota cannot be used overseas. Installing other tools with Baota overseas is also very slow because downloading data across countries back to China is naturally very slow.

The overseas version of Baota is called [aaPanel](https://aapanel.com). Please use aaPanel, which installs software quickly, and Cloud SRS will also switch to overseas mirror downloads.

Baota and aaPanel only have different installation methods, but the specific usage is the same. Please refer to [Baota](https://ossrs.net/lts/zh-cn/blog/BT-aaPanel) or [aaPanel](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-setup-a-video-streaming-service-by-aapanel-9748ae754c8c).

<a name="bt-install-manually"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Install the Latest Cloud SRS on Baota

Sometimes the version in the Baota store is older, and you can manually install the Baota plugin to install the latest plugin.

The latest version of Cloud SRS can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-cloud/releases), and the `aapanel-srs_cloud.zip` attachment in each version can be downloaded as a plugin.

After downloading the plugin, you can go to Baota `Software Store > Third-Party Applications > Import Plugin` and upload the downloaded `aapanel-srs_cloud.zip` to install.

<a name="bt-centos7-error"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## aaPanel CentOS7 Installation Failure

> Note: Ubuntu 20 (Focal) is highly recommend, please don't use CentOS.

Common errors for CentOS7 aaPanel installation failure are:

* GLIBC version issue: ```version `GLIBC_2.27' not found```
* Directory not found: ```ln: failed to access '/www/server/nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/bin/node'```

These are all due to problems with nodejs on CentOS7. Generally, after installing pm2, nodejs18 is installed, which depends on a higher version of libc, so it cannot be used.

Solution:

* Upgrade to Cloud SRS v4.6.3+ and manually install the latest version. Refer to [How to Install the Latest Cloud SRS on aaPanel](#bt-install-manually)
* Open pm2 and switch to nodejs 16, which can also bypass this problem.

> Note: Cloud SRS v4.6.3+ no longer requires pm2 to install nodejs. As long as the system has nodejs, it can be used. You can choose to install it with the nodejs manager, or with pm2, or you can install it yourself.

Finally, if it is still not available after successful installation, you can try restarting the system.

<a name="rules"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to implement the proposed features and how to record videos

Welcome everyone to submit questions and new features to Cloud SRS, but please explain the real business.

Most friends don't know what real business is, and generally describe the implementation plan of the business. However, this plan may not be the most suitable, and there may even be other technical solutions that can achieve this business goal. Therefore, please describe the business instead of describing the technical implementation of the function or plan.

Please describe the business scenario in detail and try to answer the following questions:

1. What kind of business are you in? As an ordinary person, how can I use your products and services? Please give a real example.
2. What problems are you solving in your business with SRS? Please give a real example.
3. How is the demand or function you proposed for SRS applied in the business? Please give an example.

> Note: If it is inconvenient to talk in the group, you can send it to me privately on WeChat.

The SRS cloud server open-source community works like this: you submit application scenarios, and we will prioritize implementation, using real nails to choose hammers, and welcome everyone to participate~

<a name="can-not-replay"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Unable to achieve the desired effect

If the expected effect is not achieved, such as high latency or failure to push and pull streams, the following methods can solve all problems:

```
Don't change a word, follow the video tutorial and application scenario guidance, mouse operation copy and paste, it will definitely work well!
Don't change a word, follow the video tutorial and application scenario guidance, mouse operation copy and paste, it will definitely work well!
Don't change a word, follow the video tutorial and application scenario guidance, mouse operation copy and paste, it will definitely work well!
```

Because the only reason everyone has problems is that they think audio and video are simple and make random changes!

<a name="diff-srs"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## The difference between Cloud SRS and SRS

[SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs) is an open-source server, a streaming media server, which generally works with FFmpeg and WebRTC clients to achieve audio and video capabilities. Please see [this diagram](https://github.com/ossrs/srs#srssimple-realtime-server) to understand what SRS is.

Cloud SRS is an audio and video solution that is based on SRS, Nodejs, REACT, etc. to implement common audio and video scenarios. Please see [this diagram](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-cloud#architecture) to understand what Cloud SRS is.

After SRS is installed, it opens a streaming media server demo page with links to the player and console; after Cloud SRS is installed, it opens a login management backend that provides guidance for many different scenarios.

If you need to study the streaming media server in detail, please follow the SRS documentation and join the SRS community, and do not ask in the Cloud SRS group. SRS is an open-source audio and video server, aimed at highly skilled C/C++ programmers, and you can modify it at will, with strong customization capabilities.

If you want an out-of-the-box audio and video platform that can be used online, please use Cloud SRS and do not ask in the SRS community. The meaning of Cloud SRS is SRS in the cloud. It is a cloud-based service aimed at users who do not need to understand the details of audio and video and can operate according to the tutorial.

Both are open-source projects, and contributions are welcome.

<a name="diff-baota"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## The difference with aaPanel

aaPanel is a virtual machine management tool, and SRS Cloud Server is an out-of-the-box audio and video solution. aaPanel can also install Cloud SRS, please refer to [supported platforms](#support-platform).

> Note: The overseas version of Baota is called aaPanel, which also supports Cloud SRS; if your machine is overseas, please do not use Baota, but use aaPanel; everyone uses different installation sources, and using Baota overseas may be very slow or even fail.

<a name="diff-vcloud"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## The difference with Video Cloud

Video Cloud is a large-scale service scenario, such as cloud live broadcasting, TRTC, IM, cloud on-demand, CDN, Tencent Meeting or ZOOM, which are all super-large-scale systems.

SRS Cloud Server puts all these systems in a single `Lighthouse/CVM/Droplet/aaPanel` cloud server, so it is mainly comprehensive, but the concurrency and scale are very small, only suitable for small and micro scenarios, quickly building applications to achieve business, understanding and learning new scenarios, and can run and slowly see how to implement.

Of course, in the future, SRS Cloud Server will also support migration to mature video cloud services, allowing everyone to quickly meet business requirements while also getting scalable support as the business grows.

<a name="reinstall"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to reinstall the system

If you already have a `Lighthouse/CVM/Droplet`, or there is a problem with the image, you can reinstall the image to solve it. Do not log in and mess around by yourself, it will only cause more problems, it is better to choose to reinstall the system directly.

Take Lighthouse as an example, other platforms operate similarly. First, in the application management, select Reinstall System:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-07.png)

Then, in the image type, select `Application Image`, and then select the corresponding `SRS` image, as shown below:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-08.png)

Finally, click Confirm and OK, and it will be reinstalled very quickly.

<a name="auth-bt"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to authorize troubleshooting

How to authorize machine permissions when a problem occurs? It is recommended to use aaPanel:

1. Panel settings.
2. Security settings.
3. Temporary access authorization management.
4. Create temporary authorization.

Send the temporary authorization address to the troubleshooting classmates.

<a name="openapi"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## OpenAPI

Regarding the open API, using AP to dock with Cloud SRS, you can follow the guide in `System Configuration > OpenAPI`.

All operations of Cloud SRS are done by calling the API, and these APIs can be seen in the Chrome Network panel for specific requests.

All operations that can be completed on the Cloud SRS page can be completed through OpenAPI.
