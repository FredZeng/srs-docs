Please do not try randomly, be sure to follow the guide, audio and video random testing will definitely 
cause problems.

<a name="how-to-upgrade"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Upgrade

How to upgrade to the latest version or stable version, and why not support click upgrade on the interface?

Since SRS Stack supports multiple platforms, including Docker, and Docker cannot upgrade itself, SRS Stack 
also does not support interface upgrades and needs to be upgraded manually.

If you use HELM, and get srs-stack `1.0.1` installed, then you can upgrade by `helm upgrade srs srs/srs-stack --version 1.0.2` 
and `helm rollback srs` if want to rollback to `1.0.1`.

The Docker startup specifies the version, such as `ossrs/srs-stack:v1.0.293`, and you only need to delete 
the container and start with the new version, such as `ossrs/srs-stack:v1.0.299`.

If you use `ossrs/srs-stack:1`, it is the latest version, and you need to update manually, such as 
`docker pull ossrs/srs-stack:1`.

If you use aaPanel panel, just delete the application and reinstall the new version, the data is saved in the 
`/data` directory and will not be lost.

<a name="how-to-set-domain"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Set a Domain

How to set up a domain to access the admin panel, why can't the admin panel be opened, and why can't the 
admin panel be accessed via IP.

Please replace the following domain names and IPs with your own domain names and IPs, which can be either 
private or public IPs, as long as your browser can access them.

When installing SRS Stack with aaPanel, you need to enter the domain name of the management backend, such 
as `bt.yourdomain.com`, and it will automatically create the management backend website.

> Note: When installing with aaPanel, if you want to use IP access, you can set it to `bt.yourdomain.com`, 
> and then set the `srs.stack.local` website as the default website in aaPanel.

If you install it in other ways, it's the same. You just need to resolve your domain name to the SRS Stack 
IP.

There are several ways to set up domain name resolution:

1. DNS domain name resolution: In the backend of your domain name provider, set an A record pointing to the SRS Stack IP.
```text
A bt.yourdomain.com 121.13.75.20
```
2. Modify the local `/etc/hosts` file in Linux/Unix to resolve the domain name to the SRS Stack IP.
```text
121.13.75.20 bt.yourdomain.com
```
3. Modify the local `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` file in Windows to resolve the domain name to the SRS Stack IP.
```text
121.13.75.20 bt.yourdomain.com
```

Note: If you need to apply for a free HTTPS certificate through Let's Encrypt, the IP address must be a 
public IP, and you cannot use the method of modifying the hosts file.

<a name="support-platform"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Supported Platforms

SRS Stack supports Docker images, installation scripts, DigitalOcean images, and can be installed on other 
platforms using aaPanel.

It is recommended to install directly using Docker, which also allows for multiple installations. Be sure 
to use Ubuntu 20+ system:
* Docker image installation: [here](https://ossrs.io/lts/zh-cn/docs/v6/doc/getting-started-stack#docker)

SRS Stack also support HELM, see [srs-helm](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-helm) for detail.

If you are used to aaPanel, you can install it with aaPanel, which can coexist with multiple websites. Be 
sure to use Ubuntu 20+ system:
* aaPanel: You can download the plugin for installation, and refer to [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service with aaPanel](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-setup-a-video-streaming-service-by-aapanel-9748ae754c8c) for usage.
* Script: You can also use the script directly, refer to [Script](https://ossrs.io/lts/zh-cn/docs/v6/doc/getting-started-stack#script)

It supports various cloud platforms, and the most convenient method is using images, which are cloud 
server images. If you want to keep it simple and save time, please use images:
* DigitalOcean: Overseas lightweight cloud server images, refer to [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-setup-a-video-streaming-service-by-1-click-e9fe6f314ac6) for usage.

If you find that some features are missing, it may be because the version you chose is older. According to 
the update speed of features:

```bash
Docker/Script > aaPanel > DigitalOcean
```

If you consider convenience and simplicity, the recommended order is:

```bash
DigitalOcean > aaPanel > Docker/Script
```

You can choose the platform and installation method according to your situation.

<a name='multiple-streams'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Push Multiple Streams

By default, there is only one push stream address. What if you want to push multiple streams? How to 
change the stream address?

You can change the stream name, for example, the default push stream address is:

* `rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/livestream?secret=xxx`

You can modify `livestream` to any other name, and then push directly:

* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`any`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`stream`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`you`?secret=xxx
* rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/`want`?secret=xxx

As shown in the figure below, you can click the update button to automatically change the push stream 
and playback name:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-03.png)

> Note: Of course, the playback must also be changed to the corresponding stream name.

<a name='multiple-instances'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Run Multiple Instances

The machine has a lot of CPU, how can we support more platform forwarding, or more streams and recording, 
etc.

You can choose to use Docker to start SRS Stack, which makes it very easy to run many isolated SRS Stack
instances that don't affect each other and utilize the machine resources.

For example, start two instances listening on ports 2022 and 2023, and use different ports for streaming 
media:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2022:2022 -p 1935:1935 \
  -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp --name srs-stack \
  -v $HOME/data0:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

Then, open [http://localhost:2022](http://localhost:2022) to log in to the backend.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2023:2022 -p 1936:1935 \
  -p 8001:8000/udp -p 10081:10080/udp --name srs-stack1 \
  -v $HOME/data1:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

Then, open [http://localhost:2023](http://localhost:2023) to log in to the backend.

> Note: Be careful not to use duplicate ports and make sure the mounted data directories are unique. Keep 
> the two SRS Stacks completely separate.

Although the SRS Stack web UI doesn't display the RTMP port because it uses the same port 1935 within 
the docker, this doesn't cause any issues. You can still publish to each stack using different RTMP ports.
However, you can setup the exposed ports:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2023:2022 -p 1936:1935 \
  -p 8001:8000/udp -p 10081:10080/udp --name srs-stack1 \
  -e HTTP_PORT=2023 -e RTMP_PORT=1936 -e RTC_PORT=8001 -e SRT_PORT=10081 \
  -v $HOME/data1:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

If you only need multi-platform streaming or virtual streaming without involving the push stream port, 
you can use it directly.

If you need to push streams to two SRS Stack instances, you need to specify the ports, such as pushing 
streams to these two SRS Stacks:

* `rtmp://ip:1935/live/livestream`
* `rtmp://ip:1936/live/livestream`

Other protocol ports should also be changed accordingly, such as HLS:

* `http://ip:2022/live/livestream.m3u8`
* `http://ip:2023/live/livestream.m3u8`

Of course, this doesn't mean you can start thousands of SRS Stacks. You should pay attention to your CPU 
and memory, as well as whether your machine has enough bandwidth.

<a name="bandwidth"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Insufficient Bandwidth, Acquire Additional Bandwidth

The bandwidth of lightweight application servers ranges from 4 to 20Mbps, which is somewhat limited for 
audio and video. If you want higher bandwidth, such as 100Mbps, you can choose CVM or AWS VPS.

> Note: The usage of SRS Stack is consistent, but the purchase and platform configuration are different.

The advantages of CVM cloud servers are:

* The bandwidth can be up to 100Mbps, and multiple platforms can be used to forward to other CVM servers. Ten CVMs can achieve 1Gbps bandwidth, but of course, you have to consider your budget.
* Pay-as-you-go, you can stop the machine at any time without charge, and use it again when needed. It is more friendly for low-frequency application scenarios.

The disadvantages of CVM cloud servers are:

* High cost, no free traffic package. Lightweight servers have low cost, and the free traffic package is basically enough for general live streaming. So please calculate the cost yourself.
* Complex operation, CVM's security group is much more complicated than the lightweight firewall operation. Please try it yourself. If it doesn't work, switch to lightweight.
* No background link, the interface is more complex. If it doesn't work, switch to lightweight.

If you still want to choose CVM after knowing the advantages and disadvantages, please refer to [SRS Stack: Support CVM image](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/x-PjoKjJj6HRF-eCKX0KzQ).

<a name="https"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Set up Free HTTPS

SRS Stack supports applying for free HTTPS certificates, and you can apply for certificates for multiple
domain names and automatically renew them. For example, the certificates for the following HTTPS websites 
are all automatically applied after running SRS Stack:

* https://ossrs.io SRS's overseas documentation website.
* https://www.ossrs.io SRS's overseas documentation website.
* https://r.ossrs.net SRS's stable version demo server.

The operation is very simple, just follow these three steps, please see [here](https://ossrs.net/lts/blog/2022/04/12/SRS-Stack-HTTPS):

1. Purchase a domain name and complete the filing. You must have your own legal domain name, otherwise, you cannot apply for a certificate.
2. Resolve the domain name to the public IP of SRS Stack. You can add multiple domain names to resolve, for example, `ossrs.io` and `www.ossrs.io` are both resolved to the same SRS Stack server.
3. In SRS Stack's `System Settings > HTTPS > Automatic HTTPS Certificate`, fill in your domain name, separate multiple domain names with semicolons, and click Apply.

> Note: Just apply for the domain name, do not upload it again. Once applied, you don't need to upload it again.

> Note: If you're using aaPanel to install SRS Stack, you can choose to apply through aaPanel or apply within SRS Stack.

If you encounter an error while applying and the message says `Could not obtain certificates: error: one or more domains had a problem`, the possible reasons are:

* The domain is not pointing to the SRS Stack's IP. You must use DNS to point the domain to the SRS Stack's IP, instead of setting it in the hosts file.
* The IP of the SRS Stack must be publicly accessible, meaning it should be an IP that anyone on the internet can access, not just within a private network.
* The port must be 80, not 2022, because Let's Encrypt will verify your domain in reverse and access it through port 80.

If use docker to start SRS Stack, you can add port mapping for 80 and 443:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name srs-stack -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 \
  ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After the application is successful, enter https plus your domain name in the browser, and you can 
access your website.

## How to Use Server File for Virtual Live Events

How to upload file to server and use it in virtual live events.

You can use other tools like FTP or SCP to upload large files to the server, and then use these uploaded
files in Virtual Live Events. However, it's required that the uploaded files be located in the `/data` 
directory.

SRS Stack runs inside a container, so the `/data` path mentioned refers to a directory within the container. 
You can map a directory from your host machine to the `/data` directory inside the container. For example, 
by using `docker run -v /your-host-dir:/data/my-upload`, you can access the `/data/my-upload` directory 
inside the container. 

Then, when you upload a file to your host directory, such as `my-file.mp4`, the file in the host is 
`/your-host-dir/my-file.mp4`, you can access it within SRS Stack by specifying 
`/data/my-upload/my-file.mp4`.

After uploading files, you can also enter the SRS Stack container to check if the files are present. 
For example, you can execute the command:

```bash
docker exec -it srs-stack ls -lh /data/my-upload/my-file.mp4
```

If it indicates that the file exists, you can use this file in SRS Stack's Virtual Live Events. If not, 
please check whether the path was mapped correctly when starting Docker.

## How to Modify the Push Authentication Key

If you need to update the push authentication key or change the push key, you can follow these steps:

1. Enter the `System Settings` panel.
2. Select the `Stream Authentication` tab.
3. Enter the new stream key.
4. Click the `Update` button.
5. Refresh the pages of each scene, and the push key will be automatically updated.

As shown in the picture below:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-04.png)

If you need to disable push authentication, please refer to the instructions below.

<a name="no-publish-auth"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Disable Push Authentication

In the scene page, the standard push format is with `?secret=xxx` authentication, such as `rtmp://ip/live/livestream?secret=xxx`

It is found that some cameras do not support the `?secret=xxx` format, so the address is not supported.

In this case, you can actually put the key `xxx` directly in the stream name, such as: `rtmp://ip/live/livestreamsecretxxx`, 
and there will be no problem.

Of course, if you only need to push one stream, you can directly use the key as the stream name, such 
as: `rtmp://ip/live/xxx`.

> Note: Of course, the playback must also be changed to the same stream name, and the key must be included,
> because the key is placed in the stream name here, so the playback must also be changed.

This way, there is security, and it can support devices that do not support special characters. In addition, 
the push key can be changed, so you can change it to the way you want.

<a name="record"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Record to Local Disk

How to record to the local disk of SRS Stack? After upgrading to v1.0.252, you can see local recording in 
the recording.

For the limitations and solutions of local recording, please refer to #42

<a name="update-dvr-directory"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Change the Recording Directory

Open `Record / Record Directory` to see the default recording directory. If you want to use a different directory, 
follow these steps:

If you are using Docker to start the SRS Stack, you can mount the directory to another path, like this:

```bash
docker run -v /your-host-dir:/data/record
```

If you installed the SRS Stack using another method, you can create a symbolic link from the default data 
directory to another directory, like this:

```bash
rm -rf /data && ln -sf /your-host-dir /data
```

> Note: Please do not directly create a symbolic link for `/data/record`, as the SRS Stack runs in Docker and 
> cannot see your linked directory.

Important: If you want to use cloud storage like S3, do not use the mounting method, as frequent recording 
writes may cause the cloud storage to hang and become inaccessible. Instead, use the file copying method. For 
more information, please refer to [How to Record to S3 Cloud Storage](#dvr-s3-cloud-storage).

<a name="dvr-continue-when-unpublish"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Recording Doesn't Stop When the Stream is Stopped

Why the recording doesn't stop immediately when the stream is stopped, but instead waits for a certain 
period before stopping.

Some live streams only push the content once without any interruptions. In this case, if the stream stops 
recording, it's okay to stop the recording as well. This will only generate one file.

Some broadcasters experience interruptions during live streaming. For instance, if there's a 30-second pause 
in between a 5-minute stream, stopping the recording at the pause will create multiple files. This situation 
poses a problem.

<a name="dvr-fastly-generate"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Quickly Generate a Recorded File

As mentioned earlier in [Recording Doesn't Stop When the Stream is Stopped](#dvr-continue-when-unpublish), to 
achieve recording as a single file, especially when merging into one file after interrupting the stream, the 
SRS Stack does not immediately generate a recorded file when the stream is stopped. Instead, it waits for a 
certain period before generating the file due to a timeout.

So, how can we quickly generate a recorded file after stopping the stream? You can click a button on the 
interface or use the HTTP API to request the end of the recording task after the stream is stopped. This way, 
the recorded file can be generated as quickly as possible.

Similar to YouTube's live room, there is usually an `End Stream` button in the live room. Clicking this button
will stop the stream and request the end of the recording task.

> Note: Requesting the end of the recording task is an asynchronous interface. The recorded file will not be 
> generated immediately after the call, as processing live slices takes time. Wait for a certain period before 
> the final recorded file is generated, based on the callback event.

<a name="dvr-s3-cloud-storage"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Record to S3 Cloud Storage

Record to AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean Space, and other S3-compatible storage options.

First, use [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) to mount the S3 storage to your local disk, such 
as the `/data/srs-s3-bucket` directory. Please refer to the manual of your cloud provider for specific details, 
as there are many resources available online. You can run the following command to check if you can access 
the files in the S3 storage:

```bash
ls -lh /data/srs-s3-bucket
```

> Note: It is essential to restart the SRS Stack after mounting the storage to access the mounted directory.

Next, in the SRS Stack recording settings, choose `Setup Recording Rules > Post Processing > Copy Record File`, and 
enter the folder `/data/srs-s3-bucket`. This way, after the recording file is generated, it will be copied to 
the S3 storage, and the file path in the S3 storage generally should be:

```bash
/data/srs-s3-bucket/{RECORD-UUID}.mp4
```

You can use the S3 HTTP viewing feature or CDN distribution to directly watch the recorded files or process 
them further.

If you need to disable this feature, you can set the target folder to be empty.

Please pay special attention not to mount the entire `/data` or `/data/record` directory to the cloud drive. 
The Record directory contains many temporary files, and accessing this directory while previewing recorded 
streams can cause significant stress on the cloud storage, potentially leading to suspension. It is recommended 
to use the `/data/srs-s3-bucket` directory or more specific subdirectories, such as `/data/srs-s3-bucket/yours`.

Please note that it is essential to mount the directory under the `/data` subdirectory for SRS Stack to 
access it properly. If you can only mount to other directories, it is recommended to use Docker to start 
SRS Stack and specify `-v /your-host-dir:/data/srs-s3-bucket`, allowing SRS Stack to access the files.

<a name="dvr-specific-streams"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Record a Specific Stream

How to record according to specific rules, how to record a particular stream?

The SRS Stack allows you to configure a Glob Filter, which records only the streams that adhere to the defined 
rule. To set the Glob Filter, navigate to `Record > Setup Record Rules > Extra Glob Filters`.

For instance, if the filter is configured as `/live/*`, it will record only streams within the live app, such 
as `/live/livestream` and `/live/show`, but not `/other/livestream`.

It is possible to modify Glob Filters even after initiating the recording, without restart the recording 
process. You can establish the filter even if the stream is already being published. The updated filters 
will be applied to new segments of the stream.

<a name="unavailable"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Unavailable After Installation

In the new version of the aaPanel plugin, to avoid conflicts with existing website settings, it no 
longer automatically sets itself as the default website. Instead, you need to specify a domain or manually
set the default website. Please refer to [How to Set a Domain](#how-to-set-domain).

After installation, an error is prompted, such as:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-05.png)

Or Redis is not ready, such as:

![](/img/page-2023-03-04-06.png)

This is because it takes time for SRS Stack to start after installation. Refresh the page after waiting
for 3 to 5 minutes.

<a name="restream-vs-obs"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## Difference Between SRS Re-streaming and OBS Re-streaming

SRS's multi-platform restreaming can push the stream to multiple platforms, and its working diagram 
is as follows:

```
OBS/FFmpeg --RTMP--> SRS Stack --RTMP--> Video number, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and other live streaming platforms
```

In fact, OBS also has a restreaming plugin, and its working diagram is as follows:

```
OBS --RTMP--> Video number, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and other live streaming platforms
```

It seems that OBS's link is shorter and simpler, and it doesn't need to go through SRS Stack or pay 
money. So why does SRS Stack still need to do restreaming, and what are the drawbacks of OBS's solution?

The advantage of OBS restreaming is that it doesn't cost money and can be restreamed directly. The 
disadvantage is that its uplink/upload bandwidth is doubled. For example, a 2Mbps stream, if restreamed
to 3 platforms, will be 6Mbps. If more video numbers need to be pushed, it will be even more, such as 
pushing to 10 platforms, which will be 20Mbps.

Higher bandwidth will cause all push streams to stutter or interrupt, making it impossible for all 
viewers to watch the live broadcast, resulting in a live broadcast accident. As long as there is a 
rollover once, most of the people in the live broadcast room will run away, which is a very serious
accident.

Basically, 80% of live broadcast rollovers are caused by problems with the anchor's push stream. 
Because the problems of cloud platforms and viewer viewing have been almost solved, the only unsolvable
problem is the anchor's push stream.

If you have a dedicated fiber-optic line at home, such as buying a 100Mbps dedicated line, there will 
be no problem. The problem is that a 100Mbps dedicated line is very expensive, and even if it is 
temporarily free, there will be a day when it will be charged because a dedicated line is a dedicated
resource and cannot be free forever. It's like someone giving you gold bars for free, how long can it
be free?

SRS Stack also has doubled bandwidth, but it is the downstream bandwidth that is doubled because it has
done a conversion, and essentially other platforms are downloading the stream from SRS Stack. 
Downstream/download bandwidth is generally more guaranteed. Moreover, between SRS Stack and the platform,
they are all BGP bandwidth between servers, which is more guaranteed in quality than the home-to-platform 
connection.

## How SRS Restreams to Custom Platforms

SRS's multi-platform restreaming can push to custom live streaming platforms, such as pushing to the 
video number's push stream address and stream key, and can also fill in any other live streaming platform.

> Note: The reason why SRS Stack is divided into video numbers and platforms like Bilibili is to provide 
> better guidance. The RTMP address format of these platforms is similar, so you can fill in any platform,
> and SRS Stack will not verify the specific platform.

If the RTMP address of the live streaming platform is a single address, such as:

```
rtmp://ip/app/stream
```

Then, you can split it into:

* Push stream address: `rtmp://ip/app`
* Stream key: `stream`

> Note: The part after the last slash is the stream key.

## How to Replace FFmpeg

If you are using the Docker version, you can replace the FFmpeg in SRS Stack with a custom version by 
specifying the command at startup:

```bash
-v /path/to/ffmpeg:/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
```

You can use the command `which ffmpeg` to find the path of your FFmpeg.

> Note: Non-Docker versions are not supported.

## aaPanel Installation of SRS is Very Slow

Some users have reported that overseas Baota installations are very slow, and accessing Alibaba 
Cloud's mirror is too slow.

This is because Baota cannot be used overseas. Installing other tools with Baota overseas is also 
very slow because downloading data across countries back to China is naturally very slow.

The overseas version of Baota is called [aaPanel](https://aapanel.com). Please use aaPanel, which 
installs software quickly, and SRS Stack will also switch to overseas mirror downloads.

Baota and aaPanel only have different installation methods, but the specific usage is the same. Please
refer to [Baota](https://ossrs.net/lts/zh-cn/blog/BT-aaPanel) or [aaPanel](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-setup-a-video-streaming-service-by-aapanel-9748ae754c8c).

<a name="bt-install-manually"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## How to Install the Latest SRS Stack in aaPanel

Sometimes the version in the Baota store is older, and you can manually install the Baota plugin 
to install the latest plugin.

The latest version of SRS Stack can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-stack/releases),
and the `aapanel-srs_stack.zip` attachment in each version can be downloaded as a plugin.

After downloading the plugin, you can go to Baota `Software Store > Third-Party Applications > Import Plugin` 
and upload the downloaded `aapanel-srs_stack.zip` to install.

<a name="bt-centos7-error"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## aaPanel CentOS7 Installation Failed

> Note: Ubuntu 20 (Focal) is highly recommend, please don't use CentOS.

Common errors for CentOS7 aaPanel installation failure are:

* GLIBC version issue: ```version `GLIBC_2.27' not found```
* Directory not found: ```ln: failed to access '/www/server/nvm/versions/node/v18.12.1/bin/node'```

These are all due to problems with nodejs on CentOS7. Generally, after installing pm2, nodejs18 is
installed, which depends on a higher version of libc, so it cannot be used.

Solution:

* Upgrade to SRS Stack v4.6.3+ and manually install the latest version. Refer to [How to Install the Latest SRS Stack on aaPanel](#bt-install-manually)
* Open pm2 and switch to nodejs 16, which can also bypass this problem.

> Note: SRS Stack v4.6.3+ no longer requires pm2 to install nodejs. As long as the system has nodejs, 
> it can be used. You can choose to install it with the nodejs manager, or with pm2, or you can install it yourself.

Finally, if it is still not available after successful installation, you can try restarting the system.

## Unable to Achieve the Desired Effect

If the expected effect is not achieved, such as high latency or failure to push and pull streams, the 
following methods can solve all problems:

```
Don't change a word, follow the video tutorial and application scenario guidance, mouse operation 
copy and paste, it will definitely work well!
```

Because the only reason everyone has problems is that they think audio and video are simple and make
random changes!

## The Difference Between SRS Stack and SRS

[SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs) is an open-source server, a streaming media server, which generally 
works with FFmpeg and WebRTC clients to achieve audio and video capabilities. Please see [this diagram](https://github.com/ossrs/srs#srssimple-realtime-server) 
to understand what SRS is.

SRS Stack is an audio and video solution that is based on SRS, Nodejs, REACT, etc. to implement common 
audio and video scenarios. Please see [this diagram](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-stack#architecture) 
to understand what SRS Stack is.

After SRS is installed, it opens a streaming media server demo page with links to the player and console; 
after SRS Stack is installed, it opens a login management backend that provides guidance for many different
scenarios.

If you need to study the streaming media server in detail, please follow the SRS documentation and join 
the SRS community, and do not ask in the SRS Stack group. SRS is an open-source audio and video server, 
aimed at highly skilled C/C++ programmers, and you can modify it at will, with strong customization 
capabilities.

If you want an out-of-the-box audio and video platform that can be used online, please use SRS Stack and 
do not ask in the SRS community. The meaning of SRS Stack is SRS in the cloud. It is a cloud-based service
aimed at users who do not need to understand the details of audio and video and can operate according to 
the tutorial.

Both are open-source projects, and contributions are welcome.

<a name="diff-baota"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## The Difference with aaPanel

aaPanel is a virtual machine management tool, and SRS Stack Server is an out-of-the-box audio and video
solution. aaPanel can also install SRS Stack, please refer to [supported platforms](#support-platform).

> Note: The overseas version of Baota is called aaPanel, which also supports SRS Stack; if your machine 
> is overseas, please do not use Baota, but use aaPanel; everyone uses different installation sources,
> and using Baota overseas may be very slow or even fail.

<a name="diff-vcloud"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## The Difference with Video Cloud

Video Cloud is a large-scale service scenario, such as cloud live broadcasting, TRTC, IM, cloud on-demand,
CDN, Tencent Meeting or ZOOM, which are all super-large-scale systems.

SRS Stack Server puts all these systems in a single `Lighthouse/CVM/Droplet/aaPanel` cloud server, so it
is mainly comprehensive, but the concurrency and scale are very small, only suitable for small and micro
scenarios, quickly building applications to achieve business, understanding and learning new scenarios, 
and can run and slowly see how to implement.

Of course, in the future, SRS Stack Server will also support migration to mature video cloud services,
allowing everyone to quickly meet business requirements while also getting scalable support as the 
business grows.

<a name="openapi"></a><br/><br/><br/>

## OpenAPI

Regarding the open API, using AP to dock with SRS Stack, you can follow the guide in `System Configuration > OpenAPI`.

All operations of SRS Stack are done by calling the API, and these APIs can be seen in the Chrome 
Network panel for specific requests.

All operations that can be completed on the SRS Stack page can be completed through OpenAPI.

<a name='http-callback'></a><br/><br/><br/>

## HTTP Callback

HTTP Callback refers to the SRS Stack running within a Docker container, initiating an HTTP request to 
a target URL. For instance, the following process illustrates that when OBS publishs an RTMP stream to SRS Stack,
the SRS Stack informs your server about the event by sending an HTTP request to the target URL.

```bash
                   +-----------------------+
                   +                       +
+-------+          +     +-----------+     +                 +--------------+
+  OBS  +--RTMP->--+-----+ SRS Stack +-----+----HTTP--->-----+  Your Server +
+-------+          +     +-----------+     +  (Target URL)   +--------------+
                   +                       +
                   +       Docker          +
                   +-----------------------+
```

All HTTP requests should be:

* `Content-Type: application-json`

All responses should use:

* `Status: 200 OK` and `{"code": 0}` for success.
* Otherwise, error or fail.

See examples in [HTTP Callback](/docs/v6/doc/http-callback#go-example)

### HTTP Callback: Connectivity Check

Occasionally, you might need to verify if the network is accessible and determine the appropriate target URL to 
use. By using the curl command inside the Docker container, you can simulate this request and confirm if the 
target URL can be accessed by curl or the SRS Stack.

First, install curl in SRS Stack:

```bash
docker exec -it srs-stack apt-get update -y
docker exec -it srs-stack apt-get install -y curl
```

Then, simulate an HTTP request to your server:

```bash
docker exec -it srs-stack curl http://your-target-URL
```

You can use any target URL to test, such as:

* Intranet IP: `http://192.168.1.10/check`
* Internet IP: `http://159.133.96.20/check`
* URL via HTTP: `http://your-domain.com/check`
* URL via HTTPS: `https://your-domain.com/check`

Keep in mind that you should test the connection to the target URL within the SRS Stack Docker, and avoid 
running the curl command from a different server.
