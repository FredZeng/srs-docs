## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v14.18.1

    $ npm --version
    6.14.15

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

### Yarn installation
  After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ yarn --version
    1.22.15

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
$ yarn install
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Change baseUrl

```
$ yarn cross-env BASE_URL='/custom-base-url/' docusaurus build
```

This command uses `'/custom-base-url/'` instead of the default baseUrl(`'/lts/'`) to generate static content.
