# Virtual Live Events: Revolutionizing the Way We Experience Entertainment

## Introduction

SRS Stack enables you to create virtual live events with just one click, broadcasting them to multiple platforms

event using SRS Stack.

In today's fast-paced world, virtual live events are becoming increasingly popular due to the convenience 
they offer. Whether it's a concert, a soccer game, or an online course, you can now create a virtual live 
event with your video files, making them more interactive and accessible to a wider audience. 

## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by one click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp --name srs-stack \
  -v $HOME/data:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt`.

## Step 2: Upload your video file

Once you've created your SRS Stack, open the dashboard and navigate to `Scenarios > VirtualLive > YouTube`. 
Click on `Choose File`, select your video file, and then click `Upload File`.
