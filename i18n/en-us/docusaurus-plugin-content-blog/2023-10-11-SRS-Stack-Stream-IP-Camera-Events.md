# Easily Stream Your RTSP IP Camera to YouTube, Twitch, or Facebook

## Introduction

Do you have an IP camera that supports only the RTSP protocol and want to stream it to YouTube, Twitch, 
or Facebook? The simplest solution is to use SRS Stack. With just one click, you can stream your IP 
camera to these platforms for continuous 24/7 streaming.

How to change IP Camera's RTSP stream to RTMP/RTMPS for live streaming platforms? You can use OBS or 
SRS Stack. OBS requires a device, while SRS Stack works on a cloud server and in the backend. See the 
workflow below.

```bash
IP Camera ---RTSP---> OBS or SRS Stack ---RTMP/RTMPS---> YouTube, Twitch, or Facebook
```

SRS Stack helps you connect multiple IP cameras and stream live to various platforms, making your live 
streaming experience stronger.

## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by one click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp --name srs-stack \
  -v $HOME/data:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt`.

## Step 2: Pull RTSP Stream from IP Camera

Once you've created your SRS Stack, open the dashboard and navigate to `Scenarios > VirtualLive > YouTube`. 
Click on `Forward stream`, input the RTSP url, and then click `Submit`.
