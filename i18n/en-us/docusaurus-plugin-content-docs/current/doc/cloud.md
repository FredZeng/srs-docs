# Cloud

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one, 
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

We also offer cloud services for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from scratch. 
Please choose the cloud service that best suits your needs.

## TRTC Cloud Service

For low latency live streaming and RTC(Real-Time Communication) developers, we recommend our 
[TRTC cloud service](https://ossrs.io/trtc/real-time-communication/NA?utm_source=Community&utm_medium=ossrs&utm_campaign=OBS-WHIP-TRTC&_channel_track_key=sueyNMbu), 
because it supports global network acceleration, improved congestion control algorithms, better performance on weak networks, 
client SDKs for all platforms, and a monthly free quota. Click [here](https://ossrs.io/trtc/demo?utm_source=community&utm_medium=ossrs&utm_campaign=OBS-WHIP-TRTC&_channel_track_key=lfJKyOlF)
to view the online demo. If you have any questions, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DCCH6HyhuT) channel
to contact us.
